# Vuex module builder
Vuex module builder is a wrapper for building vuex stores efficiently with DRY approach.

You can just supply your state and it will auto-generate getters for your state, actions for setting states and mutations for those actions.

It also adds some default states like fetching, deleting, creating, updating (with respective getters,actions and mutations) for loading conditions and offers a global reset action for restoring state to initial stage as well as reset for each state properties.

You also have the ability to overwrite any default behavior with your own code.

### Installation
npm install vuex-module-builder

### Example
```
-- todo.js [vuex module file]

import module_builder from 'vuex-module-builder';
import api from 'my-api';
const moule_config = {
    state: {
        todos:[],
    },
    actions:{
        fetch(store,payload){
            store.commit('set_fetching', true); //this mutations is auto generated by vuex-module-builder
                api.todos(payload)
                .then((response) => {
                    store.commit('set_fetching', false); //this mutations is auto generated by vuex-module-builder
                    store.commit('set_todos', response); //this mutations is auto generated by vuex-module-builder
                });
        },
    },
};
const store_module =  new module_builder(moule_config);
export default store_module;
 ```

with only the above code you'll get

state:

    todos:[] //your code

    fetching:false,

    creating:false,

    updating:false,

    deleting:false,

mutations:

    set_fetching

    set_creating

    set_updating

    set_deleting

    set_todos

    reset

    reset_todos

actions:

    fetch //your code

    set_fetching

    set_creating

    set_updating

    set_deleting

    set_todos

    reset

    reset_todos 

getters:

    fetching

    creating

    updating

    deleting

    todos

You can always overwrite any state,mutation,action or getters as you like.
